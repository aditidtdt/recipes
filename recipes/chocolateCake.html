        <p>
          No need to reach for a box cake mix anymore when there's a super-easy,
          no-fuss, no-baking-skills-required, rich, and chocolatey chocolate
          cake that anyone can bake from scratch.

          You've officially run out of reasons to say you can't bake a cake
          because this is the easiest recipe for making a chocolate cake.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
          <li>1 ¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
          <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
          <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>2 eggs</li>
          <li>1 cup milk</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
          <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
          <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour
            two nine-inch round pans. OR line a half sheet pan with parchment
            paper and spray with cooking spray if you want to bake a sheet cake.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking
            powder, baking soda, and salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla. Mix for 2 minutes on medium
            speed of mixer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir in the boiling water last. The batter will be thin. Pour evenly
            into the prepared pans.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven until you can insert a
            toothpick into the cake, and remove it dry. OR if you're baking a
            sheet cake, bake for only 15 minutes. Cool in the pan(s) for 10
            minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
          </li>
