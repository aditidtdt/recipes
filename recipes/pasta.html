  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Why buy the boxed stuff when you can make noodles at home? This homemade pasta recipe is way better than what you can buy at the store — and it’s surprisingly easy to throw together with just five ingredients you likely already have on hand!</p>

  <p>This homemade pasta recipe is consistently great and easy to make with flour, eggs, salt, olive oil, and water. Roll out by hand or use a pasta machine to cut dough into desired pasta shape.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 eggs (beaten)</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons water</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine flour and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
    <li>Make a well in the center and add olive oil and beaten eggs. Mix well until a stiff dough forms, adding up to 2 tablespoons water if needed.</li>
    <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Wrap dough and let rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Roll dough by hand or with a pasta machine to desired thickness, then cut into strips of desired width and length.</li>
  </ol>
