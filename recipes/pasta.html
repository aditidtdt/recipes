        <p>
          Why buy the boxed stuff when you can make noodles at home? This
          homemade pasta recipe is way better than what you can buy at the store
          — and it’s surprisingly easy to throw together with just five
          ingredients you likely already have on hand!
        </p>

        <p>
          This homemade pasta recipe is consistently great and easy to make with
          flour, eggs, salt, olive oil, and water. Roll out by hand or use a
          pasta machine to cut dough into desired pasta shape.

          <li>Combine flour and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
          <li>
            Make a well in the center and add olive oil and beaten eggs. Mix
